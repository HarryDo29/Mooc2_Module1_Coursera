    <p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/2TN46WZfiEFSEuwJ9">Bún Chả</a> is a famous Vietnamese dish, originating from Hanoi, and "Bún Chả Ta" seems to refer to a specific restaurant or variation of the dish. 
      Bún Chả typically consists of grilled pork (often served as meatballs and thin slices) accompanied by a broth made with fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, 
      garlic, and chili. The dish is served with rice noodles (bún), fresh herbs, and sometimes spring rolls (nem rán). </p>

    <p>Sometimes we walk around the neighborhood, other times we make it to the woods. Ann Arbor also has some
      beautiful lakes and rivers including the <a

      the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/NW7T8yfM4BbEYnTq6">Thao Cam Vien
